# C# Cheat Sheet

## Basics

Double Quotes (`"double-quotes"`) make your characters into a string literal meaning you literally wanted your
characters sent to the output.

This line of code below helps you output Hello World! to the terminal. It also appends a space at the end.

```C#
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!")
```

Ex output: `Hello World!`

This code is similar to the one above, but it does not append a space at the end. That is why Hello World! apears the
same in the example output

```C#
Console.Write("Hello World!")
Console.Write("World!")
```

Ex output: `Hello World!`
