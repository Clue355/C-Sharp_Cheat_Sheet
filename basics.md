# C# Cheat Sheet

## Basics

Double Quotes ("characters") make your characters into a string literal meaning you literally wanted your characters
sent to the output.

This line of code below helps you output Hello World! to the terminal. It also appends a space at the end.

```C#
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!")
```

This code is similar to the one above, but it does not append a space at the end

```C#
Console.Write("Hello World!")
```
